      content: `<h1 class="error--text font-italic">As a Summary</h1><br/>Photosynthesis is an inevitable chemical process on which our lives depend. Photosynthesis provides oxygen, food, and nutrients that help all living organisms stay healthy and alive. If we remove vegetation to construct new buildings and cities, it's like we are digging our own graves. The lack of this chemical process is a significant cause of disasters such as sunstroke and acid rain.
      Unfortunately, we are currently living in the modern world but still rely on ancient fossil fuels and photosynthesis. Fossil fuels are usually considered a non-renewable energy source as they take millions of years to form. Therefore, by rapidly depleting these fossil fuels and limiting the process of photosynthesis, we are negating the possibility of future generations on this planet. 
      Sounds trivial, but the existence of this chemical process is the cornerstone of our survival on this planet. If proper measures are not taken to sustain the plant's life and maintain photosynthesis, a scenario will occur in which the Earth becomes completely barren.
